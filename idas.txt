Issue: Going to Town is extremely annoying. At the same time, it's important to not allow spamming,
otherwise inventory space becomes meaningless.

Solutions:

- Think of a convenient way to access Town without compromising inventory importance or allowing exploits.

Changes:

Town Portal spell:
- Given to PC
- Once per rest
- Can't cheat because offset by increased inn prices

Issues:
- Temple healing service is worthless unless you're a pure warrior.
	- Inn is always significantly cheaper and you can use your healing spells to heal a lot of damage after resting.
	- Even "double resting" is way cheaper (2 gold vs 20) and will let you use spells again
- Inns are way too cheap.
	- Paying for inns is a complete non-issue, so you can basically rest to your hearts content with no penalty other than having to walk.
	- It's unrealistic. A stay in a room for a night is 1-3 gold, but a single drink of ale costs more.
	- Warriors are given pathetic little increases in health (1-3), so they have to keep repaying for inns. Annoying.
- Inn health heal is useless, no distinction between the different room types.
- Resting is an RNG Mess. Can rest between every fight pretty easily with virtually no penalty to regain all HP and spells.

Solutions:

There should be 3 tiers of resting:
1. "In Dungeon" resting, which is the most expensive but also the best (gives special benefits + is convenient), so you aren't incentivised to go back to town.
2. "Town" resting, which restores HP and spell slots. The default choice if you have mages in your party. Should be cheaper than camping supplies but more expensive than the temple.
3. "Temple" healing. Not really a rest, but good for getting back HP if you don't need spell recharges and aren't fatigued. The cheapest option.

Changes:

Increased Inn Prices:
- All inn prices increased by 100 times. //Done. Actually increased 65 times.
- Healing effect of Rest is increased by 40 times.

Camping Overhaul:
- Rests now require "Camping Supplies", which can be bought for 200 gold each //Done. Set to 150 gold for now.
- Resting is always safe //Done.
- Characters gain a bonus upon resting, depending on their kit.
	- The bonus is permanent until the next rest or until death.
