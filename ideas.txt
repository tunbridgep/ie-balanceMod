Town Portal spell:
- Given to PC
- Once per rest
- Cannot be used in combat (or, alternatively, long casting time)
- Can't rest cheat because offset by increased inn prices, it's purely a convenience thing.

Resting Overhaul:
- Resting now require "Camping Supplies", which can be bought for 200 gold each
- Resting is always safe
- Characters gain a bonus upon long-resting, depending on their kit
- The bonus is permanent until the next rest
- Inn Prices significantly increased, but still cheaper than camping supplies

Potion Overhaul:
- Healing potions heal over time

Spell Overhaul:
- Goodberries made much better, to compete with the healing spells
	- Heal 90% of the healing spells, but the cleric doesn't need to put themselves in harms way to do the healing.
